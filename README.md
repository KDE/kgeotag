# KGeoTag

KGeoTag is intended to be a minimalistic, yet functional and convenient standalone photo geotagging program for the [KDE](https://kde.org/) ecosystem. It's built upon the [Qt framework](https://www.qt.io/) and uses [Marble](https://marble.kde.org/) for the map view along with [EXIV2](https://www.exiv2.org/) for metadata manipulation.
