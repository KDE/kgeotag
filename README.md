# KGeoTag

**Warning**: This is alpha, pre-0.1 code. Until version 0.1 is tagged, this code won't be functional. Don't use this yet, it most probably will raid your fridge and steal your girlfriend ;-)

KGeoTag is intended to be a minimalistic, yet functional and convenient standalone photo geotagging program for the [KDE](https://kde.org/) ecosystem, with the Unix philosophy in mind ("do one thing and do it well").

It uses the [Qt framework](https://www.qt.io/), [Marble](https://marble.kde.org/) for the map view and [libkexiv2](https://invent.kde.org/graphics/libkexiv2) for image metadata reading and writing.
